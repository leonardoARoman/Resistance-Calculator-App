# Resistance-Calculator-App
This app calculates the resistance value by translating the three color band code of the resistor. Resistance-Calculator-App 
was written in java and it was a small school project using java GUI. The main purpose of this project was to understand the 
the funtionality of JFrame containers and EventHandlers in OOP. This project encapsulates all types of GUI techniques such as:
Nested JPanels, Grid Layouts, Inheritance and Interfaces implementations, Event Handling, and JFrame components. A sinple 
algorithm calculates the resistance value by translating the three color band code of the resistor. No tolerance is calculated
(tolarance may be the fourth and last color in a resistor)
